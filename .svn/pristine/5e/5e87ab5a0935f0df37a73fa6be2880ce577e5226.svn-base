                    <p>Ah, the technical interview. Nothing like it. Not only does it cause anxiety, but it
                        causes anxiety for several different reasons.</p>
                    How many people will be asking questions? From experience I can tell you there’s nothing
                    like walking into a room and seeing nine people on the other side of the table. Second,
                    what
                    will you be asked? You’ll sometimes hear people say the questions they were asked in a
                    technical interview were “easy”, which translated means “they asked me stuff I happened
                    to
                    know”. Sometimes you’ll hear people say the questions were “hard”, which translated
                    means
                    “they asked me stuff I didn’t know”, or “they asked me about stuff I’ve never even heard
                    of”.
                    Having been on both sides of the technical interview table, I’d like to share some tips
                    for
                    those being interviewed. In doing so, I’ll share some of the more memorable interviews
                    I’ve
                    been involved in.
                    No good interviewer expects you to know everything.
